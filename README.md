# Application-of-Data-Structure-
<h1>Applications of Arrays
To implement mathematical vectors and matrices.
To model sets or collections in computer programming.
To implement other data structures such as lists, queue, stack and heaps.
Sometimes used to emulate in-program dynamic memory allocation.</h1>
<h2>Applications of Linked lists</h2>
To implement other data structures such as queues,stacks,trees…etc
Used for dynamic memory allocation.
For manipulating polynomials, representing sparse matrices…etc
Doubly linked list can be used in navigation systems.
Doubly linked list is also used by various application to implement Undo and Redo functionality.
Advanced data structures like Fibonnacci Heap are implemented using circular doubly linked lists.
